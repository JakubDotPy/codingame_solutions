   <span class="question-statement">You are going to write a program to predict whether a specific usage pattern of electrical appliances will cause the main fuse to blow.<br><br>You have three pieces of data.<br>1. There are <var>n</var> appliances in a room, each of them has an electrical current consumption value.<br>2. A usage pattern. You will click the power buttons of a list of appliances in a sequence, at most <var>m</var> clicks. Each click on a button will toggle the power status, which means when the power is OFF, a click will turn it ON. Clicking it again will turn it OFF.<br>3. The capacity of the main fuse <var>c</var> in amperes [A].<br><br>The fuse will be blown if the sum of the consumed current of turned-on devices at some point exceeds the capacity of the main fuse <var>c</var>.<br><br>At the beginning, all appliances are OFF.</span>
