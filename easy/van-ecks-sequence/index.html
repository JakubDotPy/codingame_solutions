   <span class="question-statement">The rule here is that you start with an element <var>A1</var>, and whenever you get to a number you have not seen before, the following term is a <strong>0</strong>. But if the number <var>An</var> has appeared previously in the sequence, then you count the number of terms since the last appearance of <var>An</var>, and that number is the following term.<br><br>For a series starting with <var>A1</var> as 0, the series will be:<br><br>0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 2, 6, 5, 4, 0, 5, 3, 0, 3, &hellip;<br><br><br>Term 1: The first term is 0. <br>Term 2: Since we haven&rsquo;t seen 0 before, the second term is 0.<br>Term 3: Since we had seen a 0 before, one step back, the third term is 1<br>Term 4: Since we haven&rsquo;t seen a 1 before, the fourth term is 0<br>Term 5: Since we had seen a 0 before, two steps back, the fifth term is 2.<br><br>And so on...</span>
