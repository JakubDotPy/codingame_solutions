   <span class="question-statement">You are a manufacturer and installer of Floor-Tiles.<br><br>The beauty of Tiles comes from their symmetry, in that the quadrants of a Tile are mirror/reflections of each other.<br><br>So, when you get an order for a Tile, only the pattern of the top left quadrant (plus a little more, so you can see the center characters) are the input.  Graphically explained here:<br><pre style="font-family: monospace">☑☑☑☐☐<br>☑☑☑☐☐<br>☑☑☑☐☐<br>☐☐☐☐☐<br>☐☐☐☐☐</pre>From that limited input, your task is to:<br>Create a full Tile<br>And display a 2x2 floor (i.e., a floor consisting of 4 of those Tiles)<br><br><strong>DETAILS:</strong><br>➤ Each Tile is a square; the input therefore is also a square<br>➤ The input square shows the <strong>top left</strong> character of the full Tile, all the way to the <strong>middle</strong> character of the full Tile<br>➤ The input has a side-length of <var>N</var>; therefore the full Tile has a side-length of 2<var>N</var>-1<br>➤ The full floor needs a grout border, and grout separating the individual Tiles.  Grout is represented by <const>-</const> on top/bottom, <const>|</const> on left/right, and <const>+</const> on corners<br><br><strong>Flip/Mirror patterns:</strong><br>Generally, a character appearing in the first quadrant just replicates in the other quadrants.<br><br>However, for these special characters, you will need to sometimes print the opposite-mate of it:<br>&bull; <const>() {} [] &lt;&gt;</const>  If any of these are on the left side, then show its opposite-mate on the right side <br>&bull; <const>^v AV wm WM un</const>  If any of these are on the top half, then show its opposite-mate on the bottom half<br>&bull; <const>/\</const>  If either of these is on the top left quadrant, then show its opposite-mate on the two adjacent quadrants<br><br>(The opposite-mate is the one beside it in the character-pair as shown)</span>
