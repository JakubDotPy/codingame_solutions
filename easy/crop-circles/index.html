   <span class="question-statement">You are an intern on an Alien spacecraft, and your job is to create &quot;Crop-Circles&quot;.<br><br>You are assigned a Farming-Field that is planted with a crop of <const>{}</const><br>The Farming-Field is 25 high and 19 wide.  The naming convention is:<br>The columns are <const>a</const> to <const>s</const><br>The rows are <const>a</const> to <const>y</const><br><br>The way you are told what Crop-Circle to make is notation in the format of xyd or xydd<br>where:<br>x tells you the x coordinate of the center<br>y tells you the y coordinate of the center<br>d or dd tells you the diameter (always an integer)<br>For example <const>bc13</const> tells you center of the circle is 2nd column, 3rd row; and the diameter is 13.<br>NOTES:<br>&bull; Some Crop-Circles will not be fully in the Farming-Field, but all centers will be.<br>&bull; To be clear, a circle includes its circumference.<br>&bull; There are advanced ways to determine a circle (such as Bresenham's Circle Algorithm).  Do <strong>not</strong> use them; stick with what you learned in elementary school.<br><br>Mostly, Crop-Circles are made by mowing; so if no other instructions are given that's what you'll do.<br><br>However, your spacecraft is equipped with the latest technological advances in Crop-Circle creation, so you can also <const>PLANT</const> or <const>PLANTMOW</const>.  Here's what that means:<br><br><const>PLANT</const> = add back the <const>{}</const> crop to the entire circle.  In other words, plant back <const>{}</const> as needed, so the entire area of the circle is fully planted, including spots that have already been mowed.<br><br><const>PLANTMOW</const> = within a circle if a spot is planted, then mow it; if a spot is mowed, then plant it.  In other words reverse it.<br><br>If you are to do either of these, the key word will be before the other part of the notation.  For example: <const>PLANTgg7</const> or <const>PLANTMOWjm13</const><br><br>Now, go do your job, before you are transferred to the Human Probing Department or the Cattle Mutilation Division.</span>
