   <span class="question-statement">A strip of bushland is on fire. An aerial firefighter is dispatched to the site to put out fire using water drops.<br><br>The bushland has an area of 1 x L unit length and each water drop is effective to put out fire in 3 consecutive unit cells.<br><br>For example, if a water drop is targeted at cell 4, by splash effect it will put out fire in cell 3, 4 and 5 at the same time.<br><pre style="font-family: monospace"> _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _<br>|_|_|f|f|f|_|_|_<br> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7</pre><br>If the water drop is targeted at cell 1, fire in cell 1 and 2 will be put out.<br><br>Given the location of fire on the strip, you have to command the firefighter to put out all fire with the least number of water drops.<br><br>At this moment wind speed is very slow. You can assume the fire does not spread during your operation.<br><br>Move fast, Commander!<br><br><br><br>⏭️ <strong>What's Next?</strong><br><br>Once you have solved this puzzle, you can continue the challenge in an advanced version in 2-dimensions, interactive puzzle &quot;Forest Fire&quot;: https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/forest-fire</span>
