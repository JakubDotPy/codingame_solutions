   <span class="question-statement">For several years now, in elementary schools, we have seen the emergence of a new educational model, playful programming. The students must program a small robot using assembly blocks. This allows them to get familiar with programming from an early age while exercising their logic and perception of space.<br><br>You are a student at one such school. The purpose of the exercise is simple: your teacher has crafted a circuit for your robot, told you how many moves <var>n</var> the robot may make, and <strong>you must find out the final position of the robot at end of execution.</strong><br><br>To do this you need to know some principles of robot operation.<br>&ndash;&nbsp;When the robot encounters an obstacle (represented by <const>#</const>) it turns right (on same operation) until there's no obstacle ahead anymore. Otherwise on an empty area (represented by <const>.</const>) it moves straight ahead.<br>&ndash; The robot initially moves upwards.<br>&ndash; The robot stops after <var>n</var> moves.<br>&ndash; The top left corner represents the coordinates (0,0)<br>&ndash; The robot's environment is represented as follows, where <const>O</const> is the robot's initial position:<br><pre style="font-family: monospace">...#........<br>...........#<br>............<br>............<br>..#O........<br>..........#.</pre></span>
