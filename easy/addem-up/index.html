   <span class="question-statement">In a CardFight&reg; game, players are fighting each others by assembling a deck of cards and use strategy and tactics to defeat their opponents. Each card has a health point recorded as an integer. Cards with too low health points are quite useless in the battle arena.<br><br>However, low health point cards still have their value. CardFight&reg; company is offering a conversion service, which is a machine allowing players to insert two cards, press a recycle button, and get output of one new card with a health point equals to the sum of the two original cards.<br><br>It seems there is no upper limit to the health points in cards produced by the machine. Hurray! By making good use of this conversion machine, you can trade-in your cards to get new cards with as high health points as you wish.<br><br>You know the business rule - nothing is free. Every time when you obtain a new card from the machine, you have to pay a service fee proportional to the health point on the new card. For example, if you insert an old 1-point card and another old 2-point card, you will obtain a new card of 3 points. CardFight&reg; will debit you 3 dollars from your account.<br><br>When you have a stack of cards wishing to add up their points into a new card, you find that ordering matters.<br><br>Say, you have three cards of points 1, 2 and 3.<br>Insert 1 and 2 to get a new card of 3 points. Cost $3.<br>You now have a new 3-point card and your origianl 3-point card.<br>Insert 3 and 3 to get a new card of 6 points. Cost $6.<br>Total cost is $9.<br><br>Doing it in another way.<br>Insert 2 and 3 to get a new card of 5 points. Cost $5.<br>You now have a new 5-point card and your origianl 1-point card.<br>Insert 1 and 5 to get a new card of 6 points. Cost $6.<br>Total cost is err... $11?!<br><br>Being a smart player you should find the best strategy to finish the trade-in with the lowest cost.</span>
