   <span class="question-statement">Jack Silver is a spy from the international spy agency. <br><br>In his current mission he observes his targets at a roulette table at the Great Grand Casino in Villan City. He needs to know how much money his targets have at the end of the game.<br><br>The target plays as follows:<br>- He always bets 1/4 of the cash he currently has. If it is a fractional value, he always rounds up.<br>- The target's calls, <var>CALL</var>, can be  one of the three possibilities:<br>-- <const>EVEN</const> - He bets on an EVEN (non-zero) number<br>-- <const>ODD</const> - He bets on an ODD number<br>-- <const>PLAIN</const> - He bets on a specific number: <var>NUMBER</var><br><br><strong>NOTE:</strong> Since the odds of winning are much lower for <const>PLAIN</const> bets, the payout for a win is higher: <const>35 to 1</const>. For <const>EVEN</const> and <const>ODD</const>, the payout is <const>1 to 1</const>. As an example, if the ball comes up as 23, and the target bets 100, the payouts would be as follows:<br><br> - If he called <const>EVEN</const>, then he would lose his 100 bet.<br> - If he called <const>ODD</const>, then he would get his 100 bet back, plus an extra 100.<br> - If he called <const>PLAIN</const> and specified any number other than 23, he would lose his 100 bet.<br> - If he called <const>PLAIN</const> and specified 23 as his number, he would get back his 100 bet plus an extra 3500.</span>
