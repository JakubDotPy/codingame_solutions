   <span class="question-statement">&quot;We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents.&quot; - Bob Ross<br><br>While creating mountains in ASCII, you realized that taller mountains could start off from the smaller ones,  so why not make some more mountains?<br><br><br><br><strong>Rules:</strong><br><br>- You will be given a list of the heights of mountain peaks along a row.<br><br>- The starting height is considered as 0. <br><br>- Each step of rise in altitude is represented by '/' and fall by '\'.<br><br>- Each peak consists of a rise and fall '/\' at the appropriate height.<br><br>- Once a peak has been drawn, proceed either up or down to the next peak. Do not return to 0 between peaks.  <br><br>- After generating the mountains, end at height 0.<br><br>- You may need to draw below 0. Remember, mountains are made from a step lower than their peak. Example, for <var>-1</var> :<br><pre style="font-family: monospace">\    /   <br> \/\/</pre> which demonstrates the tip of the mountain at -1 height, given that the starting and ending point are at height 0.<br><br><br>This is an extension of &quot;Mountain Map&quot;: https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mountain-map</span>
