   <h2><span class="icon icon-goal">&nbsp;</span><span>Goal </span></h2>
   <span class="question-statement">Five girls wanted to step on a scale to measure their weights. However, as boys were nearby watching, they did not want their individual weights to be disclosed.<br><br>They chose to pair up to go on the scale. Two girls at a time, they got 10 measurements by doing 10 different pairings.<br><br>Afterwards, a problem arose. How could the 10 measurements be converted back to 5 individual weights for each of the girls?</span>
