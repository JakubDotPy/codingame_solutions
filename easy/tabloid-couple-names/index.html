   <span class="question-statement">When two famous people get together and form a romantic couple, the Tabloids love to write about them and their adventures, scandals, and relationship drama.<br><br><br>The reporters combine (smoosh) their two individual names together to create a <strong>Couple-Name</strong> -- just for fun and to make it easier to write about them.  Examples: <br><pre style="font-family: monospace">ðŸ’• Ben + Jennifer = Bennifer<br>ðŸ’• Brad + Angelina = Brangelina<br>ðŸ’• Heidi + Spencer = Speidi</pre><br>Given the following rules, print out options for each couple.<br><br><strong>RULES:</strong><br>The overall process is: <br>Smoosh a left-substring (or whole name) of one person together with a right-substring (or whole name) of the other person, in such a way that there is at least 1 <strong>overlapping</strong>-letter (aka shared letter, aka common letter).<br>âž¤ Comparisons aren't case-sensitive.<br>âž¤ No spelling changes other than &ldquo;sub-stringing&rdquo;<br>âž¤ Must contain at least one letter from each person, that isn't part of the overlapping-letter(s).<br>âž¤ Must not be shorter than the shortest individual-name.<br>âž¤ Cannot be the same as either of the individual names because that's just silly<br><br>Only Max Overlapping:<br>âž¤ Include only Couple-Names with the <strong>most</strong> overlapping-letters <strong>possible</strong>.  For example, if there is a Couple-Name that has 2 overlapping-letters, don't show others that have less than 2 overlapping-letters.<br><br>Formatting:<br>âž¤ A Couple-Name has only the first letter capitalized, regardless of the capitalization in the individual names.<br>âž¤ Where there are multiple options, list them alphabetically on the same line separated by spaces.<br>âž¤ If no options, print <const>NONE</const><br><br><br>Sorry I can't help more, but Keanu Reeves and I are headed out on some excellent &quot;Lisanu&quot; adventures, on a luxury yacht in Cannes.<br>Or maybe Eddie Mark Jacobson and I (&ldquo;Eddisa&rdquo;) will have a Big Night Out on the Gold Coast.</span>
