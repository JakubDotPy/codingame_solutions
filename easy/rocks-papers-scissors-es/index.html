   <span class="question-statement"><var>n</var> opponents, all standing in a circle around you (clockwise from player <const>0</const> to <var>n</var><const>-1</const>), have challenged you to games of &quot;Rock, Paper, Scissors&quot; at the same time. So confident are these players, that they have all shown their moves, and are waiting for you to respond. <br><br>You have to win as many of the games as you can, by playing a single move (either <const>Rock</const>, <const>Paper</const>, or <const>Scissors</const>) against an opponent of your choice (player <const>0</const> to <var>n</var><const>-1</const>), then playing the <strong>same move</strong> against the next player clockwise, and proceeding round the group until you lose a round, or you've played everybody.<br><br>- You may start with any opponent, but you must win the first game.<br>- After the first win, play the same move against each following opponent in the circle, until you lose a game, or until you have played every opponent.<br>- A draw does not count as a win, or as a loss.<br>- If there is more than one possible play with the maximum number of wins, the play starting from the lower-numbered opponent takes priority.<br><br>For anyone who never played the game: <br><const>Rock</const> beats <const>Scissors</const><br><const>Scissors</const> beats <const>Paper</const><br><const>Paper</const> beats <const>Rock</const><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors<br><br><strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">6<br>Scissors<br>Paper<br>Rock<br>Paper<br>Scissors<br>Rock</pre><br>The players surround you, and declare their moves:<br><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">    0=S<br>5=R     1=P<br>    YOU<br>4=S     2=R<br>    3=P</pre><br>Starting at <const>0</const>, you play <const>Rock</const> - you win 1 before losing to <const>Paper</const><br>Starting at <const>1</const>, you play <const>Scissors</const> - you win 1 before losing to <const>Rock</const><br>Starting at <const>2</const>, you play <const>Paper</const> - you win 1 and draw 1 before losing to <const>Scissors</const><br>Starting at <const>3</const>, you play <const>Scissors</const> - you win 1 and draw 1 before losing to <const>Rock</const><br>Starting at <const>4</const>, you play <const>Rock</const> - you win 1, draw 1, win 1 before losing to <const>Paper</const><br>Starting at <const>5</const>, you play <const>Paper</const> - you win 1 before losing to <const>Scissors</const><br><br><strong>Solution:</strong><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">Rock<br>4</pre></span>
