   <span class="question-statement">You have been looking on the network <var>packet</var> a game is sending, and you have been thinking about making a system to automatically pick things up for you!<br><br>You have found the <var>packet</var> is one big string of binary data of instructions.<br>Each instruction is formatted in this way:<br><strong>[instruction id (3 bits)][packet length (4 bits)][packet info (packet length bits)]</strong>.<br><br>What you need to do is extract the item drop instructions, they have id <strong>101</strong>, and their <strong>packet info</strong> is the item id you will need! This id might be different lengths, so look at the <strong>packet length</strong>.<br><br>What you need to send back is a set of pickup instructions, id <strong>001</strong>. Remember the packet length!<br><strong>001[item id length][item id]</strong><br><br>For example: &quot;10100010101001011&quot; we have the id and length:<br>&quot;101 0001 0101001011&quot; which means we should take 1 bit for the item id, so<br>&quot;101 0001 0&quot;.<br> Then we look at the rest of the packet<br>&quot;101001011&quot; and split that up into &quot;101 0010 11&quot; and get the second id &quot;11&quot;.<br><br>Then we just send the response &quot;001 0001 0&quot; and &quot;001 0010 11&quot;.</span>
