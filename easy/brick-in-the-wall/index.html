   <span class="question-statement">Good ol' Master Mason wants to build a wall. He's got <var>N</var> bricks lying on the floor, each of them with <strong>different weights</strong>. The height of the bricks is 6.5 cm.<br><br>The wall is built from the bottom; in every row can be no more bricks than in the row below it. Bricks can be put right on top, if the previous condition is satisfied. In every row there&rsquo;s a place for maximum <var>X</var> bricks.<br><br>Master Mason wants to minimize his work. Remembering old school days and physics lessons, he calculates the work as follows.  If a brick is built into the <strong>L</strong>-th row from the floor, the work needed to place this brick is: <strong>W = ((L-1) * 6.5 / 100) * g * m</strong>, where <strong>m</strong> is the weight of the brick measured in kilograms and <strong>g = 10 m/s&sup2;</strong> is the (not too precise value of the) gravitational acceleration. <strong>(L-1) * 6.5 / 100</strong> measures the distance the brick needs to be lift in meters. Note that the most bottom row ist the 1st one.<br><br>The task is to calculate the minimal work Master Mason can build all the bricks into a (not necessarily rectangular) wall.</span>
