   <span class="question-statement">Wizarding is a full-time job when you're an elf. Collecting ingredients, refining spells, mixing potions, uncursing travellers&hellip;<br><br>At the end of a busy day's work, elven wizards like to gather together at the magic tavern and play hooch clash. A clash works as follows:<br><br>&bull; the current king of the hill picks two glowing orbs and places them side by side on the table<br>&bull; the challenger picks two sparkling orbs and places them opposite<br>&bull; the bartender empties the hooch from each contender's orbs into a cauldron<br><br>If the glowing and sparkling liquids are provided in the exact same volume, the clash is <strong>valid</strong> and the winner is determined by fair coin toss. A valid clash is deemed <strong>fun</strong> if the four orbs on the table have a different size. A fun clash is as <strong>interesting</strong> as the challenger's two orbs are heterogeneous (different-sized), as measured by their outside, sparkling, surface area.<br><br>This tavern only has orbs of integral diameter from <var>orbSizeMin</var> to <var>orbSizeMax</var>. As many of each as you want, it's magic!<br><br>Can you help the challenger make a valid clash? Can you make it fun and interesting too?<br><br><strong>Examples</strong><br>A clash opposing {9,10} to {1,12} is fun: all orbs are different-sized.<br>A clash opposing {5,7} to {5,7} is valid: the contenders brought up equal volumes of glowing and sparkling hooch.<br>A clash opposing {1,2} to {2,2} is possible: at least three size-2 orbs are available.<br><br>Assuming you could use them for a fun clash, challenging using {31,37} would be <strong>more</strong> interesting than using {25,32}.</span>
