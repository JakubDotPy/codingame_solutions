   <span class="question-statement">There has been a murder in the village!<br>As the local detective, it&rsquo;s up to you to find out who was the killer.<br>You&rsquo;ve asked everyone where they were at the time of the crime, and who they were with.<br><br>All innocent people (aka &quot;villagers&quot;) will tell you the truth, only the killer will lie.<br>If everybody is telling the truth, then that must mean that you were the killer!<br>Can you determine who the killer was?<br><br>Some clues:<br>- The killer can claim to have been anywhere, with anyone.<br>- The villagers (non-killers) haven&rsquo;t seen the killer.<br>- The villagers (non-killers) were not in the same location as the killer.<br>- If someone claims to have been alone, that also gives you information.<br>- If everyone has a good alibi, you were the killer.<br>- If the killer claims to be alone, the claim can be proven to be false.<br><br><br><strong>Example case #1:</strong><br>Input:<br>3<br>Paul: I was in the school with Benjamin.<br>Benjamin: I was in the workshop with Raul.<br>Raul: I was in the workshop with Benjamin.<br><br>Solution:<br>Paul did it!<br><br>Explanation:<br>Benjamin and Raul gave each other alibi&rsquo;s,<br>So it must have been Paul who is lying.<br><br><strong>Example case #2:</strong><br>Input:<br>2<br>Patty: I was in the church with Bill.<br>Bill: I was in the church, alone.<br><br>Solution:<br>Patty did it!<br><br>Explanation:<br>If neither were the killer, they would both say there were in the church together.<br>If Patty was the killer, Bill would be truthful that he was alone in the church.<br>If Bill was the killer, Patty would be lying that Bill was in the church, but villagers don't lie.<br>So the only valid option is that Patty must have been the killer.</span>
