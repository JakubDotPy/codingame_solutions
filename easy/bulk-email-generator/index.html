   <span class="question-statement">You're coding on CG, minding your own business, when a notification pops out of nowhere. Some level 6 PHP coder is following you! It's all fine and dandy. You click on the dismiss button and move on.<br><br>Except it doesn't work. The dreaded red popup appears: &ldquo;Error 492, please send us an email at coders@codingame.com&rdquo;. Being the disciplined coder you are, you comply.<br><br>But the notification is still there. So you click it again. And read the popup again. And email coders again. But the notification is still there&hellip; You can't really send them the same email all the time, that would be boring!<br><br><strong>It's time for some automation!</strong><br><br>You are given a bulk email template. You are to expand it to an actual email by selecting a clause randomly when given a choice.<br><br>Choices are indicated by <const>(</const>parenthesized text<const>)</const>, with clauses separated by pipe symbols <const>|</const>.<br><br>Random is defined as using the JBM level-0 twister: &ldquo;for the <var>i</var>th choice, pick the <var>i</var>th clause (modulo the number of clauses)&rdquo;.</span>
