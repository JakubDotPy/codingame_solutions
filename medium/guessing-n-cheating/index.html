   <span class="question-statement">Alice and Bob are playing a guessing game. Alice thinks of a number between 1 and 100 (both inclusive). Bob guesses what it is. Alice then replies &quot;<strong>too high</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>too low</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>right on</strong>&quot;. After repeated rounds of guessing and replying, Bob should be able to hit right on the number.<br><br>After some games, Bob suspects Alice is cheating - that she changed the number in the middle of the game, or just gave a false response. To collect evidence against Alice, Bob recorded the transcripts of several games. You are invited to help Bob to determine whether Alice cheated in each game.<br><br>An example game between <strong>B</strong>ob and <strong>A</strong>lice:<br><br>A game of 3 rounds<br><pre style="font-family: monospace">┌───┬──────────┐<br>│ B │    A     │<br>├───┼──────────┤<br>│ 5 │ too high │<br>│ 1 │ too high │&lt;-- round 2<br>│ 2 │ right on │<br>└───┴──────────┘</pre>Alice cheated in round 2<br><br>(...because numbers below 1 are not allowed in the game)</span>
