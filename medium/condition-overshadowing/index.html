   <h2><span class="icon icon-goal">&nbsp;</span><span>Goal </span></h2>
   <span class="question-statement">Condition overshadowing can be a possible cause for unreachable code in a computer program and solving this problem can help detect it.<br><br>Programs often define a chain of conditions in the form of: if ... else if ... else if ... else if<br>Some of those conditions can be overshadowed by previous conditions.<br><br>The meaning is fairly intuitive: an overshadowed condition is a condition for which any values satisfying the condition also satisfy at least one previous condition, thus making the overshadowed block of code unreachable.<br><br>The goal is to detect all overshadowed conditions in a chain of conditions and output their serial position in the chain. The first condition has index 0.<br><br>Overshadowed conditions in real-life programs can be extremely hard to detect, but here the conditions are simplified to only an integer variable <var>x</var> compared to an integer constant <const>c</const> (and still this isn't so simple...)<br><br>Note: <strong>Partial</strong> overshadowing does not count, while <strong>complete</strong> overshadowing (which leads to totally unreachable code) counts.<br><br><strong>In the example:</strong><br>Condition (x == 9) is overshadowed by condition (x &gt; 4).<br>Condition (x &lt; 6) is overshadowed by conditions (x &gt; 4) and (x != 5).<br>Condition (x != 5) is only partially overshadowed by condition (x &gt; 4) and hence is not treated as part of the answer.</span>
