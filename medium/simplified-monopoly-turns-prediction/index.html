   <h2><span class="icon icon-goal">&nbsp;</span><span>Goal </span></h2>
   <span class="question-statement">Your goal is to recreate a simplified turns prediction for the Monopoly&trade; game.<br><br>You'll be given a list of players with their names and their initial positions, a list of dice rolls, and a list of names of all the game board positions. You'll need to find the <strong>latest position</strong> for each player after all the given dice rolls.<br><br><strong>GAME BOARD</strong><br><br>The game is played on a <strong>circular</strong> game board.<br>There are 40 positions on the board, indexed from <const>0</const> to <const>39</const>.<br><br><strong>BASIC RULES</strong><br><br>Each player rolls two dice, and moves forward <const>the sum of the dice rolled</const> positions.<br>Multiple players can occupy the <strong>same</strong> position.<br>If a player reaches position <const>39</const> and still needs to move forward, he'll continue from position <const>0</const>. In other words, positions 38, 39, 0, 1, 2 are contiguous.<br>Unless something special happens (see below), his turn ends after moving.<br><br><strong>DOUBLE RULES</strong><br><br>A double refers to a roll where both dice have the same value.<br>If the player rolls a double, then he rolls the dice and moves again.<br>If the player rolls a double three times in a row, then he immediately goes to jail (see below) and his turn ends there.<br><br><strong>JAIL RULES</strong><br><br>The <const>Visit Only / In Jail</const> position has a dual nature: the player is either visiting only, or actually in jail, depending on how he got there.<br><br>If at the end of a basic move, the player lands on <const>Go To Jail</const>, then he immediately moves to the position <const>Visit Only / In Jail</const> and is in jail. His turn ends.<br>If the player rolls a double for the third time in a single turn, then he immediately moves to the position <const>Visit Only / In Jail</const> and is in jail. His turn ends.<br><br>If after moving, the player lands on <const>Visit Only / In Jail</const>, he is visiting only and is <strong>not</strong> in jail.<br><br>While the player is in jail, he still rolls the dice on his turn as usual, but doesn't move until either:<br>(a) he rolls a double, or<br>(b) he fails to roll a double for three throws (i.e. his previous two turns after moving to jail and his current turn).<br>If either (a) or (b) happens in the player's turn, then he moves forward <const>the sum of the dice rolled</const> positions and his turn ends. He doesn't roll the dice again even if he has rolled a double.<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> <const>Visit Only / In Jail</const> is at position <const>10</const>. <const>Go To Jail</const> is at position <const>30</const>.</span>
