   <span class="question-statement">You probably know the game of life, if you don't: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life<br>It is a cellular automaton created by John Conway in 1970. An infinite grid made of dead and living cells that changes each turn following specific rules:<br>A living cell will survive only if it has 2 or 3 neighbours (&lt;2: isolation death, &gt;3: overpopulation death).<br>If a dead cell has exactly 3 neighbours, it comes back to life, else it stays dead.<br><var>neighbours</var> is the number of neighbours with Moore neighbourhood (8 cells).<br><br>You will be given new rules and will have to adapt the evolution of the grid to these:<br>The first line is the condition of surviving of a living cell, and the second line is the birth condition of a dead cell. The index within the line is the number of neighbours, 0 to 8. Living is represented by <const>1</const>, dead by <const>0</const>.<br>Your goal is to output the grid given in input after <var>n</var> turns and with specific given rules.<br><br><strong>Example: Classic rules</strong><br>001100000   A living cell survives if it has 2 or 3 neighbours, and dies if 0,1 or 4+.<br>000100000   A dead cell is back to life if it has 3 neighbours, and stays dead if any other number.<br><br>A cell outside the grid will always be considered as dead.</span>
