   <span class="question-statement">You are tired of your daily routine as a developer, and thus decide to take some vacation and go on a road trip!<br><br>You consider inviting <var>N</var> friends to come along. Your travel plan has a base cost of <var>C</var>, independent of the number of travelers, and an additional cost of <var>P</var> per person.<br>Each of your friends has a limited <var>budget</var>. Your friends have their pride: they won't accept money from others, hence every traveler - including yourself - has to pay the same price (keep in mind that this amount might not be an integer). A friend that cannot afford the trip will decline your invitation.<br>Since you have developed countless Java applications, you are very rich and will always be able to afford the vacation.<br><br>Each friend brings you a certain amount of <var>joy</var> by coming along on the trip.<br>Among your friends, there are some people that you don't really like: they bring you negative <var>joy</var>. Being a pragmatic person, you still consider inviting them to lower the price per person, and allow your real friends to come.<br><br>Your happiness is the sum of the <var>joy</var> brought to you by every friend that comes along on the trip.<br>Find the maximum happiness that you can get if you invite the right friends.</span>
