   <h1><span class="icon icon-rules"> </span><span>Rules</span></h1>
   <div>
      <div class="statement-rules-content">
         You operate on a 10x10 square map.<br />
         At each turn, your program receives the map of the forest and the state of each square.<br />
         Based on this data, your program must determine which forest square to send water to in order to put out the fire.<br />
         Unfortunately, under certain circumstances, as described below, fires spread to neighbouring squares.<br />
         To win you must put out all the fires, while limiting the number of squares burned to a maximum given to you in the variable <var>maxBurnedForest</var>.<br />
         <br />
         <h2>The map</h2>
         Each of the 10 lines of the map is given to you by a string. Each character represents a cell of the map.<br />
         <action>.</action> represents an empty square with no forest. It cannot burn.<br />
         <action>^</action> represents a forest square.<br />
         <action>*</action> represents a burned forest square. It can no longer catch fire.<br />
         <action>1</action>, <action>2</action> or <action>3</action> represents a forest square on fire. The value corresponds to the development level of the fire.<br />
         <br />
         <h2>The spread of fire</h2>
         Fire on a square can have 3 levels of development and, unless fought, evolves as such:<br />
         <ul><li>fires grow by one level per turn,</li><li>except for level 3 fires which, on the next turn, turn into burned forest squares and spread the fire to their 4 neighbouring squares (N/S/E/W) if 
               <ul><li>the neighbouring square is a forest square, not burned,</li><li>there is not already a fire on this square.</li></ul>
               The fire on these neighbouring squares starts at level 1.
            </li></ul>
         <br />
         <h2>Fighting fire</h2>
         Once per turn you can extinguish the fire in a square by spraying it with water.<br />
         The fire in this square is extinguished immediately and does not spread to neighbouring squares.<br />
         To determine the box for which you want to fight the fire, you simply write its <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong> coordinates (or column and row) on the standard output.<br />
         <br />
         <h2>Sequence of actions</h2>
         In each turn, the game follows the following actions, in this order
         <ol><li>Extinguish the fire on the square determined by your program.</li><li>Evolution of the remaining fires (1&gt;&gt;2, 2&gt;&gt;3, 3&gt;&gt;burned)</li><li>Spread of fire around the squares that have just been burned</li></ol>
         <br />

         <h2>Winning and losing</h2>
         You lose if
         <ul><li>you do not send the coordinates of a game square within the time limit,</li><li>the number of squares burned exceeds the maximum indicated in <var>maxBurnedForest</var></li></ul>
