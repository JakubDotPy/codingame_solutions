   <span class="question-statement">Imagine you have a bag, which is filled with <var>N</var> balls. Each ball can have the color <strong>black</strong> or <strong>white</strong>.  You know that <var>W</var> balls in the bag are white.<br><br>If you extract a ball from the bag, the probability changes of the remaining balls.<br><br>Your job is it to output the ratio of the odds that you extracted <var>k</var> white balls after extracting <var>s</var> balls from the bag.<br>Balls are never put back into the bag!<br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br>You have 3 balls in the bag, 2 of which are white.<br>What is the probability of having 2 white balls by extracting 2 balls? <pre style="font-family: monospace">2/3 * 1/2 = 1/3</pre><br>When <strong>A</strong> is the event of getting 2 white balls:<br>P(A) = Probability of getting 2 white balls = <strong>2/3 * 1/2 = 1/3</strong><br>P(!A) = Probability of not getting 2 white balls = <strong>1-1/3 = 2/3</strong><br><br>So the ratio P(A) : P(!A) is  <strong>1:2</strong> (read 1 to 2).<br><br>The ratio <strong>2:4</strong> would be the same ratio, but both numbers are divisible by <strong>2</strong>, so you need to reduce the ratio.</span>
