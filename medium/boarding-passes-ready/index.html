   <span class="question-statement">CodinGame Airlines are always trying to improve efficiency. To that end, they are trying a new way of boarding passengers onto their planes:<br><br><strong>Boarding group 1:</strong> Starting from the back row of the plane, and working up to the front, board the <strong>left-most</strong> waiting passenger whose seat is on the <strong>left</strong> half of the row. <br><strong>Boarding group 2:</strong> Starting from the back row of the plane, and working up to the front, board the <strong>right-most</strong> waiting passenger whose seat is on the <strong>right</strong> half of the row<br><br>Repeat for the next boarding groups, until everyone is on board. Empty boarding groups do not need to be called.<br><br><strong>You must call the <var>name</var> of the passengers in each boarding group, in the order the passengers should board, when it's that group's turn.</strong><br><br><strong>Notes:</strong><br>- Seat <const>1A</const> is the left-most seat of the front row of the plane.<br>- The aisle always divides the seats evenly: In a plane with 6 seats to a row, seats <const>A</const>,<const>B</const>,<const>C</const> are on the left, and <const>D</const>,<const>E</const>,<const>F</const> are on the right.<br>- Some seats may be unsold. If a seat is unsold, the next eligible passenger in that half of the row boards.<br><br><strong>Example</strong><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">4<br>4<br>8<br>Alice,1A<br>Brian,2C<br>Cathy,2D<br>Debra,4C<br>Ellen,4D<br>Frank,2B<br>Geoff,1C<br>Helen,3A</pre><br><var>w</var>=4, so the seats are <const>A</const> &amp; <const>B</const> on the left, <const>C</const> &amp; <const>D</const> on the right<br>After boarding, the passengers will be seated like this:<br><pre style="font-family: monospace">             FRONT<br>    A     B         C     D  <br>1 Alice ----- xxx Geoff -----<br>2 ----- Frank xxx Brian Cathy<br>3 Helen ----- xxx ----- -----<br>4 ----- ----- xxx Debra Ellen</pre><br><strong>Boarding Group 1: Left hand side, from row <const>4</const> to row <const>1</const></strong><br>- There is no passenger in <const>4A</const>, or <const>4B</const>. Nobody boards<br>- Call <strong>Helen</strong> to board seat <const>3A</const><br>- There is no passenger in <const>2A</const>; Call <strong>Frank</strong> to board seat <const>2B</const><br>- Call <strong>Alice</strong> to board seat <const>1A</const><br><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">Now boarding: Helen,Frank,Alice</pre><br><strong>Boarding Group 2: Right hand side, from row <const>4</const> to row <const>1</const></strong><br>- Call <strong>Ellen</strong> to board seat <const>4D</const><br>- There is no passenger in <const>3D</const>, or <const>3C</const>.
