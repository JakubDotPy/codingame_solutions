   <span class="question-statement">Your blood type is comprised of two blood groups: ABO  (A, B, AB, or O) and Rh (+ or -), which are inherited from parents.<br><br>Inheritance is closely related to the genes pairing mechanism. Each person has two genes to determine his/her ABO blood type, as listed below:<br><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">AA = A blood type<br>AO = A blood type<br>BB = B blood type<br>BO = B blood type<br>OO = O blood type<br>AB = AB blood type</pre><br><br>Each biological parent donates one of two ABO genes to their child. For example, a parent of O blood type with genes OO and a parent of A blood type with genes AA will have a child with one A gene and one O gene (AO), which is an A blood type.<br><br>Suppose the A blood type parent in the above example is having genes AO, it is possible to have a child of blood type either A or O.<br><br><strong>Rh Factor</strong><br>Rh factor refers to a protein that may be found on the covering of red blood cells. If your red blood cells have this protein, you are Rh+. Otherwise, you are Rh-.<br><br>Just as everyone inherits ABO genes, every person inherits one Rh gene from each biological parent, which finally determines whether the Rh protein is present.<br><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">++ = Rh+<br>+- = Rh+<br>-- = Rh-</pre><br><br>Combining ABO type and Rh factor, there are eight blood types:<br><strong>A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, O-</strong><br><br>We use this expression to describe the blood type inheritance relationship:<br>parent + parent = child<br><br>There are 3 variables in the equation. Two variables will be given. You are going to determine all possible values in the unknown variable.<br><br>For example, A- + O+ = ?<br>Answer is A+, A-, O+, O-</span>
