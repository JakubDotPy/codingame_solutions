   <h2><span class="icon icon-goal">&nbsp;</span><span>Goal </span></h2>
   <span class="question-statement">John has to draw a lot of regular polygons with an increasing number of sides. <br>More precisely, John has got two numbers <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> and he must draw regular polygons with the number of sides:<strong> a, a+1, a+2, ..., b-2, b-1, b</strong>.<br><br>For example, if <var>a</var> = 3 and <var>b</var> = 6, John must draw an equilateral triangle, a square, a regular pentagon, and a regular hexagon.<br><br>Because John wants to do the job precisely, he intends to draw as many polygons as possible by geometric constructions (it means using only a straightedge and compass).<br><br>Based on Gauss&ndash;Wantzel theorem we know that:<br>A regular <strong>n-gon</strong> (that is, a polygon with <strong>n</strong> sides) can be constructed with compass and straightedge if and only if <strong>n</strong> is the product of a power of 2 and any number of distinct Fermat primes (including none).<br>A Fermat prime is a prime number of the form <strong>2^(2^m)+1</strong>. Where <strong>m</strong> is a natural number. <br><br>Help John and write a program that will calculate how many polygons from the given range can be drawn using geometric construction.</span>
