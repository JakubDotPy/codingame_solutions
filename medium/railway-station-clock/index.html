   <h2><span class="icon icon-goal">&nbsp;</span><span>Goal </span></h2>
   <span class="question-statement">The old clock in the railway station is too ancient to be refurbished but too nice to be replaced with a modern one.<br>But it is a little slow. To be precise, <strong>every four minutes it goes behind by one more second</strong>.<br><br>The clock is stable in its delay. In addition the station administrator adjusts the clock <strong>daily at 8AM</strong>.<br>So it's not that bad.<br>But still all the train events recorded in the official station log are timewise wrong.<br><br>You need to create a script to recover <strong>true times</strong> having <strong>times observed from the station clock</strong> as input.<br><br>Please note, you don't need to worry about fractions of a second (all tests are guaranteed to have whole seconds for both <strong>observed</strong> and <strong>true</strong> times).</span>
