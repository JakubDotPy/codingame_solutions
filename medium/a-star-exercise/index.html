   <span class="question-statement">You are given an undirected graph with weighted edges, a <var>start</var> and a <var>goal</var> node, and for each node the heuristic value, which is the estimated distance to the end. Your task is to trace a canonical A* execution (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm ) by computing a shortest path from the start to the goal.<br><br>We recall that the A* algorithm will rely on three values for each node <var>v</var>:<br>- the <const>g-value</const>, which is the minimum distance from the <var>start</var> to <var>v</var>;<br>- the <const>h-value</const>, which is an estimation of the minimum distance from <var>v</var> to the <var>goal</var> and is given by the heuristic provided in input;<br>- the <const>f-value</const>, which is the sum of the g-value and h-value.<br><br>There is always a path between the start and the goal. The given heuristic is admissible and consistent, meaning that the A* algorithm will always find a shortest path from the start to the goal.<br><br>When some nodes have the same f-value, the one with the smaller identifier is considered first.</span>
