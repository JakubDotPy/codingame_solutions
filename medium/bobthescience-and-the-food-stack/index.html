BobTheScience went to a food store. He saw a food store which sells <var>m</var> colorful pancakes, each weigh <var>p</var>[<var>i</var>].
 He wants to eat all the pancakes,
but with the following exceptions:<br />
      <b>1. </b>You need to serve the <var>m</var> pancakes in <var>n</var> stacks.<br />
      <b>2. </b>You need to make it so that the difference between the maximum weight and the minimum weight doesn&#39;t exceed <var>d</var>.<br /><br />
<b>Example: </b>You need to rearrange 7 pancakes into 3 different stacks, and <var>d</var> is 3. The weights of the pancakes are <b>[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1]</b>.
1 optimal solution for this testcase is:<br />
<b>1. </b>Place the 1st pancake in the 1st stack.<br />
<b>2. </b>Place the 2nd pancake in the 1st stack.<br />
<b>3. </b>Place the 3rd pancake in the 2nd stack.<br />
<b>4. </b>Place the 4th pancake in the 2nd stack.<br />
<b>5. </b>Place the 5th pancake in the 3rd stack.<br />
<b>6. </b>Place the 6th pancake in the 3rd stack.<br />
<b>7. </b>Place the 7th pancake in the 3rd stack.<br />
The total weight of each stack is now <b>[3, 4, 6]</b>, and the difference between the maximum stack and the minimum stack does not exceed <var>d</var>,
which is 3<br /><br />
<b>Note:</b><br />Each pancake&#39;s weight doesn&#39;t exceed <var>d</var>.<br />
Make sure you add an end line character (&#39;\n&#39;) to the code. (For some programming languages only)<br />
