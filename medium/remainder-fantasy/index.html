   <span class="question-statement">This was a puzzle invented and solved by Chinese during the 3rd to 5th centuries AD, with innovative solution steps recorded in Mathematical treaties of that era. Translated the text into modern terminologies:<br><br><strong>Let x be an integer. Divide x by 3, remains 2; divide x by 5, remains 3; divide x by 7, remains 2. Find the minimum value of x.</strong><br><br>You are going to solve similar puzzles with the aid of state-of-the-art technologies and know-how. Take the challenge?<br><br><br>Beware, the moduli you are given may not be pairwise coprime. Moreover, your answer must always be as small as possible while being <strong>greater than or equal to</strong> every modulo in input. For instance, if you are asked for an integer x such that:<br>- it remains 3 when dividing x by 8<br>- it remains 11 when dividing x by 15<br>- it remains 1 when dividing x by 10,<br>then the answer is 131. In this example, 11 is not a valid answer since it is less than 15 (the modulo in the second constraint).</span>
