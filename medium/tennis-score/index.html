The player who wins a majority of the sets wins the match.<br><br><strong>* &quot;Normal&quot; set :</strong><br>To win a normal tennis set, you must win 6 games with a difference greater than or equal to 2.<br>After the score reaches 6-5 the next score is either 7-5 (first player wins the set) or 6-6 ( (see below for tie-breaks)). When one player wins the tie-break the set score is either 6-7 or 7-6. <br><br><strong>* &quot;Normal&quot; game :</strong><br>To win a normal tennis game (see below for tie-breaks), you must score at least 4 points, with at least 2 points more than your opponent.
