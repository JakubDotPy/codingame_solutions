      <h2><span class="icon icon-goal"> </span><span>Goal </span></h2>
      <span class="question-statement">In this game, you control a mouse swimming in a pool trying to escape the cat.
      The cat is running around the pool and will try to catch you, but the cat will never go in the water. The goal is simply to escape from the pool without being trapped by the cat.<br />
      If your mouse reaches the border of the pool and the distance from mouse to cat is greater or equals than <const>80</const> you win the game.
         <br /><br />

         The game is played inside a pool of radius <strong>500</strong> pixels where 0,0 is the center of the pool (represented by a little green dot)<br /><br />

         The mouse has a maximum speed <const>MOUSE_SPEED</const> of <strong>10 Pixels / turn</strong> so then when providing a target destination the mouse will move
         towards this destination but the distance will be capped to MOUSE_SPEED.<br /><br />
         The cat has a dynamic speed that will be provided in input.<br /><br />
         There is no physics in this game so the mouse can change completly its direction from one turn to another.
         <br /><br />
         The mouse is captured by the cat if the distance between mouse and cat is strictly less than <const>80</const> and then you lose the game.<br />
         If you are not able to escape after <const>350</const> turns then you also lose the game.<br /><br />
         You can display a gaming message capped to <strong>27 Chars</strong> on the panel located in the left upper corner of the map (see details below).

         The cat is moving using the shortest path around the pool to target the closest point where the mouse can escape<br />
         This is the closest intersection of straight [Center pool/mouse position] and pool edges.
