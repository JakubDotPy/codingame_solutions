   <span class="question-statement"><strong>Story:</strong>  <br><br>Jasmine is on her desk, looking at the pile of papers that has been assigned to her for the week. But her mind has been wandering outside, thinking  &quot;How many days it would take to finish writing any given number of papers given she writes the minimum number for each paper?&quot; You must help her track this for each day until the last day where the number of papers left is 0.<br><br><br><strong>Rules:</strong><br><br>To understand how she completes writing the papers in this hypothetical world, let's assume she has <var>n</var> papers where each paper has a page count from a range of <var>0</var> to <var>2 ^ p</var><br><br>i)	Find the lowest page count from the <var>n</var> papers<br>ii)	Subtract up to that page count for all of the <var>n</var> papers.<br>iii)	Ignore the ones who have 0 pages left for the next turn<br>Repeats these steps until finally, all papers have 0 pages left to be completed.<br><br><br>To obtain the page count for the papers, we use a linear congruential generator expression (random number generator) : <br><strong>Z(n+1) = (1664525 * Z(n) + 1013904223) MOD  2 ^ Power </strong><br><br>Here, the initial value of <strong>Z(0)</strong> is passed as <var>seed</var> [but not kept in the list of papers] and <strong>power</strong> as <var>power</var> from the IDE. Then the expression is executed for <var>N</var> number of times to find the number of pages in sequential order.<br><br><br><strong>For testcase 1:</strong> <var>seed</var>   = 7,   <var>paper</var>   = 5,   <var>power</var>   = 3<br><br>--&gt; For the number of pages of the first paper, we use the expression (1664525 * 7 + 1013904223) MOD  2 ^ 3 and obtain the first value as 2<br><br>--&gt; For the number of pages of the second paper, we use the expression (1664525 * 2 + 1013904223) MOD  2 ^ 3 and obtain the second value as 1 &hellip;.. <br><br>We repeat this until all of the pages counts for the starting list are obtained as [ 2, 1, 4, 3, 6 ] <br><br><strong>Table representation:</strong><br><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">2   1   4   3   6       # The starting list is always ignored<br>-------------------------------<br>1   0   3   2   5	 [4 papers left]<br>0   0   2   1   4	 [3 papers left]<br>0   0   1   0   3	 [2 papers left]<br>0   0   0   0   2	 [1 papers left]<br>0   0   0   0   0	 [0 papers left]</pre><br><strong>Output:</strong> 4 3 2 1 0               <br><br>Note: If the initial list of page counts has 0 present, it is considered only for the starting list as the lowest page count, and not later on.</span>
