   <span class="question-statement">A rational number is a number that can be expressed as the fraction p/q of two integers. We are going to describe a Number System which covers rational numbers.<br><br>We start with two <strong>seeds</strong> of rational numbers: 0/1 and 1/0.<br><br>ðŸ‘‰ 0/1 is zero. In this context it is the <const>smallest</const> rational number if we exclude negative numbers.<br>ðŸ‘‰ 1/0 is usually undefined and causes error in computing. But now we define it to be the <const>largest</const> rational number in our Number System, within computer's capacity.<br><br><br>Then, we find the <strong>mediant</strong> of the two extreme seeds.<br>ðŸ‘‰ The mediant of a/b and c/d is defined as (a+c)/(b+d).<br><br>Insert the mediant in between.<br><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">       0/1  1/0<br>     0/1 (1/1) 1/0<br>0/1 (1/2) 1/1 (2/1) 1/0</pre><br>For every two adjacent terms, insert a mediant. The row will grow in length indefinitely.<br><br>We can represent these terms in a <strong>binary tree</strong>.<br>ðŸ‘‰ The above row of numbers is the inorder-traversal of the binary tree.<br><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">0/1................         ,................1/0<br>                   ,~ 1/1 ~.<br>                 ;           :<br>               ;               :<br>            1/2                 2/1<br>          /     \             /     \<br>       1/3       2/3       3/2       3/1<br>      /   \     /   \     /   \     /   \<br>     1/4  2/5  3/5  3/4  4/3  5/3  5/2  4/1</pre><br><br>1/1 is the <strong>root</strong> of the tree.<br>All rational numbers in the tree will not duplicate. All positive rational numbers in the Number System can be found somewhere in the tree. The tree itself is a subset of the Number System.<br><br>Using computer scientists' term, we use <strong>L</strong> and <strong>R</strong> to denote the left and right branches of a node in a binary tree. We specify a number by tracing its <strong>path</strong> from the root.<br><br><strong>Some examples:</strong><br><br>3/5 is LRL<br>2/5 is LLR<br>8/5 is RLRL<br><br><strong>Tasks:</strong><br><br>You will be given some rational numbers. Translate them into L-R paths.<br>You will also be given some L-R paths. Translate them into the rational numbers as they are found in the tree.<br><br>ðŸ‘‰ All rational numbers in the tree are in reduced form. There is no 6/4 but there is 3/2.<br>ðŸ‘‰ To keep them as fractions, we do not simplify 2/1 into 2. We keep expressing it as a numerator and a denominator.<br>ðŸ‘‰ The two seeds and the root shall have special symbols other than L-R to represent them. In this puzzle we will not involve these special symbols.<br>ðŸ‘‰ Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Brocot_tree</span>
