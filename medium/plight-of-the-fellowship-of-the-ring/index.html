   <span class="question-statement"><strong>Story:</strong><br><br>Help the fellowship! They are trapped in the mines of Moria, with orcs closing in from all sides. Their only hope is Gandalf&rsquo;s wizardry. Gandalf can create portals through which they can quickly travel from one spot to another. However portals can be opened in limited spots only, and in a limited number of ways. Your program must print the path they should follow to be safely out.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------- xxx ---------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Rules:</strong><br><br>The Spots will be <const>INDEXED</const> as 0, 1, 2, 3, ...<br><br>You will be given the <const>COORDINATES OF THE SPOTS</const> to where Gandalf can create a portal. <br><br>You will be given the <const>COORDINATES OF THE ORCS</const>.<br><br>You will also be given the <const>POSSIBLE PATHS</const> from one spot to another. (the indexes)<br>(<strong>note:</strong> the paths are double sided. this means that if a path is possible from spot <var>2</var> to spot <var>5</var>, then it is possible to go from <strong><var>2</var> to <var>5</var></strong>, as also from <strong><var>5</var> to <var>2</var></strong>)<br><br>--------------------------------------------------- xxx ---------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>The Problem:</strong><br><br>Your algorithm should display the sequence of the spots in order of how the fellowship go in order to reach the end fastest, and safely. <br>(<strong>note</strong>: the fellowship can travel from one spot to another along the <const>POSSIBLE PATHS</const> only) <br><br>You will be given the index of the <const>STARTING SPOT</const> and also the <const>ENDING SPOT</const>. <br><br>--------------------------------------------------- xxx ---------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> <br><br><strong>1.</strong> For every move of the fellowship, each orc can move by a distance of 1. If you need N moves to reach a spot, and distance from the starting point of an orc to that spot is &le; N, you cannot go there or you might be killed.<br><br><strong>For example,</strong> if spot <var>2</var> and spot <var>5</var> are connected by a path, and coordinates of <var>2</var> is <strong>(1,0)</strong> and <var>5</var> is <strong>(2,2)</strong>, and an orc is present at <strong>(1,2)</strong>, then the fellowship cannot go from spot <var>2</var> to spot <var>5</var>, as time taken by the fellowship is <var>1 UNIT</var>, and distance moved by the orc in 1 unit time is <var>1 UNIT</var> (<strong>(2,1)</strong> and <strong>(2,2)</strong> are separated by distance <var>1 UNIT</var>).<br><br><strong>2.</strong> The fellowship can only move along the paths from one spot to another. <br><br><strong>For example,</strong> if spot <var>2</var> and spot <var>5</var> are connected by a path, and coordinates of <var>2</var> is <strong>(1,0)</strong> and <var>5</var> is <strong>(2,2)</strong>, then from <var>2</var> the fellowship can <strong>move only to</strong> <var>5</var>, and not to any random spot {say <strong>(1,2)</strong>} [i.e. they can only move to a <strong>spot</strong>, which is <strong>connected</strong>] .<br><br><strong>3.</strong> Distances are calculated by the distance formula: <strong>dist = sqrt( (p1.x-p2.x)^2 + (p1.y-p2.y)^2 )</strong> (i.e. distances are <strong>Pythagorean</strong>)</span>
