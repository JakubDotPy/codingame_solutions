   <span class="question-statement">You love cooking. Therefore, you often go to the shop to buy ingredients for your recipes. Sometimes, you can't, so you ask your dog to go. But he can't read numbers, so he doesn't buy the quantities you need. Given the recipe and the list of ingredients your dog bought, with their respective quantities, find how many times you can cook this meal before you run out of an ingredient.<br>Output the first ingredient that will be running out, how many times you can cook, and how much of each ingredient you will have left.</span>
