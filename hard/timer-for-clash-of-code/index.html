   <span class="question-statement">You have to implement a version of the timer in Clash of Code. The timer changes based on players joining.<br>The timer starts at 5:00 and runs towards 0:00. <br><br>Here are the rules:<br>* Every time a player joins the clash, the game is set to start at <br><br>   <pre style="font-family: monospace">t - 256 / ( 2^(p - 1) )</pre><br>   where <var>t</var> is current time in seconds and <var>p</var> is the number of players in the room.<br>* If the result is under 0:00, set it to 0:00.<br>* If a player joins at the same time the game is supposed to start, set the new time  <br>   instead of starting the game.<br><br>For example:<br><br>5:00<br>When the timer starts there is one player (the one who started the clash).<br><br>at 4:47 the second player joins -&gt; set to start 256 seconds from now, at 0:31<br>at 3:56 the third player joins -&gt; set to start 128 seconds from now, at 1:48<br>at 3:13 the fourth player joins -&gt; set to start 64 seconds from now, at 2:09<br>2:09, the game starts<br><br>Output: 2:09<br><br><br><br>The game starts if:<br>* The timer reaches the time it is set to stop at, or<br>* The timer reaches zero and there is more than one player, or<br>* The clash room is filled (8 players in total, 7 have joined)</span>
