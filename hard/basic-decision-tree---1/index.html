   <h2><span class="icon icon-goal">&nbsp;</span><span>Goal </span></h2>
   <span class="question-statement">You are a beetle scientist and you have to identify the species of a lot of male beetles in your research.<br>Currently, you can easily identify these beetles after they are fully grown up.<br>However, in your research, you want to identify the species of the male beetles while they are still pupae.<br><br>Since beetles' pupae actually show the rough shape of the grown beetles,<br>you are able to measure the shape of their horn while they are still pupae.<br>Based on your observation, you found that there is a difference in the horn size of the pupae of different beetle species.<br>So you want to create a decision tree to identify the species of the beetles purely based on pupae horn sizes.<br><br>The tree is created by dividing one group into 2 groups repeatedly.<br>We split the group by a separator, which will be a pupa's horn length.<br>The length is selected to divide the group into 2 groups.<br><br>Starting from 1 single group with all beetle pupae,<br>step 1. we choice 1 beetle pupa in the group if there are multiple beetle species in the group<br>step 2. pupae with smaller horn sizes will be separated into a sub-group =&gt; step 1<br>step 3. all other pupae in the group will be separated into another sub-group =&gt; step 1<br><br>We scan through all pupae in the group and choice one beetle as a separator.<br>The equation of how we choose the pupa to be the separator is <const>Binary Entropy</const>.<br>And we find the best separator in the group with the <strong>smallest</strong> <const>Weighted Entropy</const>.<br><br>Entropy equations as this picture: https://imgur.com/gBWJ6fB.png<br><br>We keep creating branches for the binary tree until we have 0 entropy. (all pupae in a group is in 1 single species)<br><br>If 2 separators have the same entropy, we will always choose the pupa with a smaller index.<br>After we separate a group, we breakdown the group with smaller horns until we reach 0 entropy, and then we start working on the other group.<br><br>The output will be the index of the last separator (pupa) in the binary tree.<br><br>----<br>Given this input:<br><br>4<br>0 1 1<br>1 2 1<br>2 3 2<br>3 4 2<br><br>It shows that we have 4 pupae with their corresponding horn lengths from 1 to 4.<br>Since their index is from 0 to 3, we will name them pupa-0, pupa-1, pupa-2, and pupa-3.<br>--<br>If we select pupa-0 as the separator, nothing will change since there is no pupa have a smaller horn length then pupa-0.<br><br>If we select pupa-1 as the separator, pupa-0 will be separated into one sub-group, pupa-1,2,3 will be in another sub-group.<br>Pupa-0's group has a binary entropy of 0.<br>Pupa-1,2,3's group have a binary entropy of 0.9183.<br>Weighted entropy will be <const>0.6887</const>.<br><br>If we select pupa-2 as the separator, pupa-0,1 will be separated into one sub-group, while pupa-2,3 will be in another sub-group.<br>Pupa-0,1's group has a binary entropy of 0, and pupa-2,3 as well.<br>Weighted entropy will be <const>0</const>.<br><br>If we select pupa-3 as the separator, pupa-0,1,2 will be in one sub-group, and pupa-3 will be in another sub-group.<br>The resulting entropy will be <const>0.6887</const>.<br>--<br>Select pupa-2 will have 0 entropy.<br>The output should be <const>2</const>.</span>
