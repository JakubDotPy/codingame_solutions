   <span class="question-statement">John is one of those &quot;super smart&quot; kids. At least that's what his teachers, family, and friends call him. John is prone to competitions, his favourite types of competitions are those involving words. He spends his free time reading a variaty of books, science papers, even things that don't actually interest him, just so he could expand his vocabulary. In 2015, he was the world champion in a game called <strong>KGood</strong>. As his best friend, I asked him how did he manage to pull off such an amazing thing. To which he replied with a smirk on his face, &quot;I know a cool trick&quot;.<br><br>Last week, as he was riding his bike and watching a beautiful sunset, he didn't see the pole in front of him so he fell and hit his head! A few days later, John is feeling much better, but oh NO! He forgot what the trick was! Since I'm his best friend, he asked me to help him out anyway I can, because the World Championship 2016 is only 15 days away and he has to defend his title of the World Champion! Unfortunately, I am not one of those smart kids so I need Your help, else John is going to lose his title!<br><br>A string is called <strong>KGood</strong> if and only if it has no more than (ie. less than or equal to) <strong>K</strong> different characters (lowercase letters of English alphabet). Substring of a string is an array of consecutive characters of the original string. Your task is to find the length of the longest KGood substring of a given string.<br><br>For example:<br>Let the given string be <strong><const>aaaaabcdef</const></strong> and let <strong><const>K = 3</const></strong>.<br>The longest KGood substring we can form is <strong><const>aaaaabc</const></strong>, hence the output should be <strong><const>7</const></strong>.</span>
