   <span class="question-statement">In the wonderful words of <strong>Servatta</strong> they use a very peculiar language.<br>They utilize <strong>the English alphabet</strong> for their writing, their <strong>vowels are &quot;aeiou&quot;</strong>, the <strong>consonants are the rest</strong>.<br><strong>Words can be broken into syllables</strong>, a syllable consists of <strong>a vowel</strong> with at most <strong>two consonants on each side</strong> of it (so syllables can be of the form e, te, et or tet). <strong>Consonants tend to belong to the next vowel in the word</strong>, unless there's <strong>two of them next to each other</strong> (in which case they split Ser|vat), or it's <strong>the last letter in the word</strong> (Ser|<strong>vat</strong>). Having two consonants at the end of a word is not grammatically correct.<br>When breaking up words at the end of the line, a <strong>hyphen</strong> gets placed at the end of one of the syllables, and the rest of the word continues on the next line:<br>Servat-<br>ta<br><br>Lemi is the only journalist in the entire country and he types out every article in a very basic monospace text editor. <br>He has the following way of breaking up lines manually: he tries to <strong>fill the current line with as many words as possible</strong>, then he tries to <strong>fit partial words into the remaining space</strong>. After this he <strong>moves onto the next line</strong>. He always pays attention so that he <strong>never breaks up a word if it would mean only one letter would be left before the hyphen</strong> though, so the following is invalid:<br>a-<br>tara<br><br>One day Lemi has decided that he had enough, and swore to never type anything ever again, but because he doesn't want to get fired, he asked you to write a program that would do this for him instead.</span>
