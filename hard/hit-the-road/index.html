   <h2><span class="icon icon-goal">&nbsp;</span><span>Goal </span></h2>
   <span class="question-statement">A driver is on a road network with <var>n</var> junctions and <var>m</var> roads with two specific positions <var>s</var> and <var>t</var>. <br>Each junction of the network can be associated with a time window <var>[b,e]</var> : the driver can go through that intersection only between times <var>b</var> and <var>e</var>. Every other junction is free : the driver can cross it at any time. Each road is associated with a duration: the time a car needs to drive through that road. <strong>The roads are directed : the car cannot go through a road backwards.</strong><br><br>Your goal is to decide if a driver can go from <var>s</var> to <var>t</var> such that, for each junction associated with a time window <var>[b,e]</var>, the moment <var>r</var> when the driver reaches that junction belongs to its window : b &lt;= r &lt;= e. If the junction has no time window, the driver can reach it at any time.<br><br>The driver starts in <var>s</var> at time <const>0</const>.<br><strong>The driver cannot wait. Once he reaches a junction, he must go though an outgoing road of that junction.</strong><br>The time windows are always closed intervals.<br><br>Here is an example where &lt;, &gt;, ^ and v represent roads (and the directions).<br><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">s &gt; u &gt; w &gt; t</pre> <br><pre style="font-family: monospace">v   ^   v   ^</pre> <br><pre style="font-family: monospace">x &gt; y &gt; z &gt; r</pre><br><br>The time window on x, u and y is <const>[1,2]</const>.<br>The time window on w, z and r is <const>[3,5]</const>.<br>The time window on t is <const>[1,7]</const>.<br>The duration on each arc is <const>1</const>.<br><br><br>It is possible to go from s to t with that path.<br><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">s           t</pre> <br><pre style="font-family: monospace">v           ^</pre> <br><pre style="font-family: monospace">x &gt; y &gt; z &gt; r</pre><br><br>The driver would be in x at time 1, y at time 2, z at time 3, r at time 4 and t at time 5. Each time fits within the specified time window.<br><br>In this example with the same time windows and same durations :<br><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">s &gt; u &gt; w &gt; t</pre> <br><pre style="font-family: monospace">v   ^   v   ^</pre> <br><pre style="font-family: monospace">x &gt; y   z &gt; r</pre><br><br>You cannot go from s to t, because you must go through w in order to reach t and  it is not possible to be in w between time 3 and 5 and in u between time 1 and 2:<br>- either the driver goes from s to u and arrives at w at time 2;<br>- or it uses the path s x y u w and arrives at u at time 3.</span>
