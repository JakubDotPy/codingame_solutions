   <span class="question-statement">Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters, within a certain number of guesses.<br><br>You are the moderator. Given an entry word or sentence, check the input letters in order. If the entry is completed, the game is won: display the resulting hangman and the final entry. The player is allowed 5 mistakes, corresponding to hangman's head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg. At the 6th mistake, the right leg is drawn and the game is over. If a letter is repeated more than once, the repeating occurrences are always considered as an error, even if the first time was correct.<br><br>A hangman will look like this after 0 to 6 errors. There should be no whitespace at the end of lines.<br><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">+--+   +--+   +--+   +--+   +--+   +--+   +--+<br>|      |  o   |  o   |  o   |  o   |  o   |  o<br>|      |      |  |   | /|   | /|\  | /|\  | /|\<br>|\     |\     |\     |\     |\     |\/    |\/ \</pre></span>
