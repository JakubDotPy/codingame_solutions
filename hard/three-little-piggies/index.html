   <span class="question-statement">The three little pigs have to build their houses on the field of grass but they fear the big bad wolf. Help them place their 3 homes on their land so that they can be protected. Sometimes, there are only two pigs but you still must place the three houses.<br>Their land is a 4&times;4 grid which has X&rsquo;s for grass and dots (periods) for trees. The pigs, which always stay on the same spot of grass and are too lazy to move, show up as P&rsquo;s. The big bad wolf, who will only show up at night, is a W (during the day he&rsquo;s sleeping in his lair).<br>For example:<br><br>Day:<br><pre style="font-family: monospace">.XX.<br><const>P</const>XXX<br>XX<const>P</const>X<br>.XXX</pre><br><br>Night:<br><pre style="font-family: monospace">.<const>W</const>X.<br>XXXX<br>X<const>PP</const>X<br>.X<const>P</const>X</pre><br><br>The straw house&rsquo;s tile is an L with the house in the corner:<br><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">Hs<br>s</pre><br><br>The sticks house&rsquo;s tile is a bar with the house in the middle:<br><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">SHS</pre><br><br>The brick house&rsquo;s tile is a longer L:<br><br><pre style="font-family: monospace">HBB<br>B</pre><br><br>You can rotate but not mirror the tiles: the longer L can become a 7, never a &Gamma;.<br>The tiles can&rsquo;t cover a tree or the wolf.<br><br>There are two kinds of inputs: one for day and one for night (only at night a wolf can be seen).<br>If it is day: place the houses so that the pigs can be seen. No tile much cover a pig.<br>If it is night: place the houses so that each pig is covered by an H. A house might not cover a pig, if there are only two pigs.<br><br>Each puzzle has a single solution.</span>
