   <h2><span class="icon icon-goal">&nbsp;</span><span>Goal </span></h2>
   <span class="question-statement">You must output the result of an Einstein's riddle.<br><br>An Einstein's riddle  is a logical puzzle where <var>nbPeople</var> people  are assumed to all have different names, different characteristics...<br>It means if Georges eats Salad, then none of the others can eat Salad. And also, if Georges eats Salad, then he cannot eat anything other than Salad.<br><br>Each line of input contains a list of characteristics that are all in the same category. For example, in the first test case, the first category is the individual's first name, the second is their means of transportation, the third is the type of plant they like, and finally the pet they own. <br><br>Each category of characteristic has <var>nbPeople</var> different possibilities. For example, the second line lists various means of transportation, and it has 4 possibilities (<const>Autobus</const>, <const>Car</const>, <const>Bicycle</const> or <const>Roller</const>) so that each person has one, and only one, associated means of transportation.<br><br>You are given a number of relational links that can be either in the format:<br><br><const>Georges &amp; Salad</const> which means <const>Georges</const> eats <const>Salad</const><br><br>or <const>Georges ! Salad</const> which means <const>Georges</const> doesn't eat <const>Salad</const>.<br><br>The relational links can be on any two characteristics, and permit the riddle to be solved using logic. The relational links are guaranteed to be sufficient to solve the riddle, and are always non-contradictory. For example, we can't have <const>Georges &amp; Salad</const> and <const>Georges ! Salad</const>.<br><br>The goal is to solve the riddle and print it as a grid, separated by space and newline, with each person in their own column and each characteristic category on its own line.<br><br>The characteristics in the first line will be ordered alphabetically, and each subsequent line will have the characteristics of that category ordered such that they match up correctly with the characteristics in the first line of output. In this way, each column of the output corresponds to the same person, with each person associated with one characteristic from each category.</span>
