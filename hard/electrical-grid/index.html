   <span class="question-statement">Edison is bringing electricity to <var>N</var> houses. He has already set up a power generator in house 1 and wants to connect it to the other houses. There are <var>M</var> pairs of houses that can be connected together, and we know how much making a link between each pair costs. Your job is to find which houses to link so that all the houses are connected to house 1 (directly or through other houses), while minimizing the total cost.<br><br>* **there is always a solution that connects all houses**<br>* **the total distance from the generator to a house does not matter, as long as there is a path between them**</span>
