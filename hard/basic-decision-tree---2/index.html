   <h2><span class="icon icon-goal">&nbsp;</span><span>Goal </span></h2>
   <span class="question-statement">You are a beetle scientist and you have to identify the species of a lot of male beetles in your research.<br>Currently, you can easily identify these beetles after they are fully grown up.<br>However, in your research, you want to identify the species of the male beetles while they are still pupae.<br><br>You had already done a one-dimensional decision tree to separate the pupae:<br>https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/basic-decision-tree---1<br>However, the paper got rejected because the result is not significant enough.<br>You decide to include more features to see if you can improve the accuracy of the decision tree.<br><br>Before you start this puzzle, it is highly recommended to finish the first one,<br>since we will follow the same entropy algorithm.<br><br>You will have <const>PN</const> pupae with their <const>index</const>, <const>species</const>, and features.<br><br>This time, instead of using only horn length as the separator,<br>you are given <const>FN</const> features and you will want to select <const>FM</const> features that will have the lowest entropy.<br>If 2 different sets of features can have the same entropy, we will choose those features with a smaller index.<br>The output features index should be in numerical order.<br><br>The index of features are from <const>1</const> to <const>FN</const>.<br><br>For example:<br><br>You have <const>4</const> pupae each with <const>3</const> features, (<const>PN</const> and <const>FN</const>)<br>and you need to select the <const>2</const> best features. (<const>FM</const>)<br>Pupa-0 is species <const>1</const> and has feature values <const>1</const>, <const>1</const>, <const>2</const><br>Pupa-1 is species <const>1</const> and has feature values <const>1</const>, <const>2</const>, <const>1</const><br>Pupa-2 is species <const>2</const> and has feature values <const>1</const>, <const>2</const>, <const>2</const><br>Pupa-3 is species <const>2</const> and has feature values <const>1</const>, <const>2</const>, <const>2</const><br><br>By selecting feature <const>1</const> and <const>2</const>, we scan through both features with the method in the previous puzzle.<br>The best separator will be pupa-1's feature <const>2</const>,<br>and can separate the pupae into [(0), (1, 2, 3)] with entropy <const>0.6887</const>.<br>After that, we are not able to find any other separator to decrease the entropy.<br><br>By selecting feature <const>1</const> and <const>3</const>, we get similar result as get entropy <const>0.6887</const>.<br><br>By selecting feature <const>2</const> and <const>3</const>, we first separate pupae into [(0), (1, 2, 3)] with pupa-1's feature <const>2</const>.<br>And then further separate pupa-1,2,3 into [(1), (2, 3)] with pupa-2's feature <const>3</const>.<br>The tree at the end will be [(0), [(1), (2, 3)]], with entropy <const>0</const>.<br><br>Therefore, the output should be <const>2</const> and <const>3</const>.<br><br>P.S. pupa index is not used in this puzzle</span>
