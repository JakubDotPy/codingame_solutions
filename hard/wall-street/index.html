   <span class="question-statement">On Wall Street people <const>buy</const> and people <const>sell</const>.<br>When a buyer and a seller's prices match a trade is created.<br>When there is no match the order is <strong>&ldquo;put in the book&rdquo;</strong>.<br><br>Some special cases that must be considered:<br>- If the buyer's price is higher than the seller's price: the price used is the one already in the system.<br>- If there are more than one order in the system at the same price: a first in first out approach is taken.<br>- A trade cannot be concluded between orders that aren't on top of the book: the best price is always traded first. For a <const>buy</const> order the best price is the highest; for a <const>sell</const> order the best price is the lowest.<br>- A trade can only occur between orders on the same stock symbol.<br>- If there are remaining quantities after a trade, we try to trade with the next order in the book. If we can't, we put an order <strong>&ldquo;in the book&rdquo;</strong> for the untraded quantity.<br><br>An order consist of a <var>symbol</var> that represents the stock to trade, a <var>verb</var> that indicates whether it's a <const>BUY</const> or a <const>SELL</const>, a quantity <var>qty</var> and a <var>price</var>.</span>
