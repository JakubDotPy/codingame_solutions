   <span class="question-statement">&ldquo;I have enjoyed the journey. The happiness of these days, I would have never known living in the castle. I've seen people as they are, without pretense. I've seen their beauty and their ugliness with my own eyes.&rdquo;<br>&mdash; Princess Yuki<br><br>Hidden fortresses are placed on a <var>size</var> x <var>size</var> grid.<br>You don't know their number and you don't know their locations.<br>For each cell of the grid, you're given the number of fortresses that share the same row and/or the same column.<br>Those numbers are joined together to form a grid of <var>size</var> rows of <var>size</var> characters.<br>To describe every possible number with one character, the following symbols are used in order:<br><const>&quot;0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&quot;</const><br>so numbers [10-35] are given with [a-z] and numbers [36-61] are given with [A-Z].<br><br><br>You must deduce the fortresses' locations and output the grid of revealed fortresses.<br><br>For example in the following example, there's a 3 in cell (1, 0), meaning that there are a total of 3 fortresses in row 1 and/or column 0. In the solution, you can see that these fortresses are located at cells (0, 0), (1, 0) and (1, 2).</span>
