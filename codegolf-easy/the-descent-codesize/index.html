<h2><span class="icon icon-goal">&nbsp;</span> <span>The Goal</span></h2>

<div class="statement-goal-content">Destroy the mountains before your starship collides with one of them. For that, shoot the highest mountain on your path.</div>
</div>
<!-- RULES -->

<div class="statement-section statement-rules">
<h2><span class="icon icon-rules">&nbsp;</span> <span>Rules</span></h2>

<div>
<div class="statement-rules-content"><strong>At the start of each game turn</strong>, you are given the height of the 8 mountains from left to right.<br />
<strong>By the end of the game turn</strong>, you must fire on the highest mountain by outputting its index (from 0 to 7).<br />
<br />
Firing on a mountain will only destroy part of it, reducing its height. Your ship descends after each pass. &nbsp;</div>

	<li>If your ship is located on the same cell (<var>spaceX</var> variable) as the highest mountain, shoot with <action>FIRE</action>!</li>
	<li>Else, wait with <action>HOLD</action> to keep shot ready for when you reach the highest mountain.</li>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<div class="story-text">
<div>&ldquo;<i><b>Captain&#39;s log, stardate 1567.9.</b> We are entering the Deneb system two days after receiving a distress call issuing from the unexplored planet XIV of this system. Our mission is to bring aid to whomever is in need of our help on this planet.</i>&rdquo;</div>
&nbsp;

<div>&ldquo;<i><b>Captain&#39;s log, supplemental.</b> While reaching the planet, our rescue ship was drawn to a point on the surface by an invisible force that we have yet to understand. Despite all efforts, the ship continues its downward course and we are at great risk of colliding with the mountains that tower below us.</i>&rdquo;</div>
&nbsp;

<div>&ldquo;<i><b>Captain&#39;s log, supplemental.</b> In a final attempt, Scotty was able to re-engineer the phase cannons so that they can now destroy the mountains from their foundations. This gives us hope of landing safely on the planet. <strong>We are now looking for a crew member able to program the firing rate</strong> <strong>of the phase cannons </strong>to get us out safely from what clearly appears to be a trap designed to destroy us.</i>&rdquo;</div>
