   <span class="question-statement"><strong>Mahjong</strong> is a tabletop game played using tiles. It features three &quot;number&quot; suits (pins, sous, mans, represented as <const>p</const>, <const>s</const> and <const>m</const>) from <const>1</const> to <const>9</const>, and one &quot;honor&quot; suit <const>z</const> of seven distinct tiles. Note that contrary to western card games, tiles are not unique.<br><br>https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5595067/33491135-4ac4b4e6-d6f4-11e7-8df6-038f113fcef9.png<br><br>To complete a hand and win, the 13 tiles in your hand are combined with 1 newly drawn tile and must result in one of the following winning configurations:<br><br>&emsp;&bull; <strong>4 sets</strong> and <strong>1 pair</strong>, self-explanatory<br>&emsp;&bull; <strong>seven pairs</strong>, where all pairs are distinct (twice the same pair wouldn't qualify)<br>&emsp;&bull; <strong>kokushi musou</strong>: one of each of the <const>1</const> and <const>9</const> of each number suit, one of every seven honors, the remaining tile forming a pair. (e.g. <const>19m19p19s11234567z</const>)<br><br>A <strong>pair</strong> is any of the two same tiles: <const>11m</const>, <const>33s</const>, <const>44p</const>, <const>55z</const>, etc.<br><br>A <strong>set</strong> consists of 3 tiles of the same suit. It can either be a <strong>run</strong>: 3 number tiles (<const>p</const>, <const>s</const> or <const>m</const>) in a connected run like <const>123s</const> or <const>234s</const>, but not <const>1m 2p 3s</const> or<const>234z</const>; or a <strong>triplet</strong> of any suit, not necessarily numbers, like <const>111z</const>, <const>222m</const>.<br><br>So honor tiles (non-numbers, represented by <const>z</const>) can only form pairs or triplets, but not runs. <const>567z</const> is not a set, <const>555z</const> is a valid set, <const>55z</const> is a valid pair.<br><br>A single tile can only be counted as part of one set or pair: there is no sharing or reusing.<br><br>Given a <var>sorted hand</var> of <const>13</const> tiles and one <var>tile</var>, check whether the <const>14</const> tiles make up a completed hand.</span>

Tiles are grouped per suit, so each letters is written at most once.
