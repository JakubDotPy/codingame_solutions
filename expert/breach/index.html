   <i>All locks have been reverse-engineered from the hacking game Intercept. Big thanks to <a href="https://bubmet.itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">bubmet</a> for permission!</i><br /><br />
   <h2><span class="icon icon-goal">Â </span><span>Goal </span></h2>
   <span class="question-statement">An anonymous game development company has hired you to break into 
   a rival company&#39;s servers. Fortunately, your target decided to forego standard security software
   and instead implement a series of puzzles designed to be difficult to solve. 
   You decide to use your programming skills to automate the solving of these puzzles.<br /><br />
   
   
   From your initial probes, you have determined there are 10 different locks, grouped into 3 categories.<br />
   - <strong>ss_f</strong>: int<br />
   - <strong>ss_m</strong>: int<br />
   - <strong>ss_n</strong>: int<br />
   - <strong>ss_asc</strong>: int<br />
   - <strong>ss_con</strong>: series, state machine, 1<br />
   - <strong>ss_colv</strong>: str<br />
   <br />
   - <strong>rs_f</strong>: int<br />
   - <strong>rs_n</strong>: int<br />
   - <strong>rs_colv</strong>: str<br />
   <br />
   - <strong>gs_m</strong>: str, 2<br />
   <br />
   
   Your probes have also shown you what type of input these locks expect. They are listed in the table above.<br /><br />
   Unfortunately, you don&#39;t know how to solve these locks. You need to figure out how to do so in order to complete this puzzle!

   <div class="title">Color Codes</div>
   Colors are represented by 2 characters: <const>\u00AC</const> and a char representing the color.<br />
   There are 15 colors, along with 1 modifier:<br />
   - <strong>GRAY: W</strong><br />
   - <strong>WHITE: w</strong><br />
   - <strong>RED: R</strong><br />
   - <strong>LIGHT_RED: r</strong><br />
   - <strong>GREEN: G</strong><br />
   - <strong>LIGHT_GREEN: g</strong><br />
   - <strong>BLUE: B</strong><br />
   - <strong>LIGHT_BLUE: b</strong><br />
   - <strong>YELLOW: y</strong><br />
   - <strong>ORANGE: o</strong><br />
   - <strong>PINK: P</strong><br />
   - <strong>LIGHT_PINK: p</strong><br />
   - <strong>VIOLET: V</strong><br />
   - <strong>LIGHT_VIOLET: v</strong><br />
   - <strong>CORRUPT: ?</strong><br />
   - <strong>RESET (modifier): * - resets the color to the default (green)</strong><br />
   Hint: Some locks require colors to be solved!
