   <span class="question-statement">At the beginning the 2 players see a pile of letters, all different. In turns they can choose to get <strong>the first or the second letter</strong> of the pile. At the last turn, the last player has no choice but getting the last letter.<br>Then, the players score according to the words they can build with their collected letters. A dictionary gives the possible words with their associated gains. Letters can be used several times to form several words.<br><br>You have to advise the first player for its first turn: what letter is best to choose, and what scores are expected for each player, when the two players play their best choice at each turn.<br><br>For the player 1, the purpose is to have the higher positive difference between its score and the opponent's score. For example, '10-2' is a better result than '15-14', which is better than '20-25'.<br><br>This puzzle is a simple game to implement a <strong>minimax</strong> algorithm. You may need to optimize your code with <strong>alpha-beta pruning</strong> for some tests.</span>
