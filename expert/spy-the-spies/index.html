   <span class="question-statement">Six (<const>6</const>) enemy spies have entered the country. It is your job to indicate the enemies from a list of fifteen (<const>15</const>) suspects, using known attributes (appearance, ethnicity, etc.). Each suspect may be associated with multiple attributes, and there are often overlaps.<br><br>Try to find the shortest list of commands that will indicate the enemy spies, but will not indicate any of the innocent suspects. You can issue these commands: <br><br> - an attribute that is common to one or more of the enemies, but not the innocent suspects<br> - <const>NOT</const> an attribute to indicate something that is common to one or more of the innocent suspects, and not to the enemy spies<br><br>Note that a command only gives information about spies who are associated with the given attribute, and doesn't imply any information about those not associated with the given attribute.<br><br>Each command given will eliminate <strong>ALL matching</strong> suspects from the current (potentially reduced) list, either absolving them as innocent, or indicating them as spies. Commands build on each other, so any suspects eliminated by a command will not be considered for future commands. The ordering of commands is significant, and the test cases are crafted such that the <strong>shortest</strong> list of commands only has a single valid ordering.<br><br><strong>Example 1</strong><br><br>Ned is an enemy spy<br><br>Tonya is french and has blue-eyes<br>Ned is english and has blue-eyes<br>Cindy is tall<br><br>There are several ways to indicate Ned as the spy in this group:<br><br><strong>NOT french</strong>   &lt;-- absolves Tonya<br><strong>NOT tall</strong>   &lt;-- absolves Cindy, leaving Ned<br><br>OR<br><br><strong>NOT tall</strong>  &lt;-- absolves Cindy<br><strong>NOT french</strong>  &lt;-- absolves Tonya, leaving Ned<br><br>OR<br><br><strong>english</strong>  &lt;-- indicates Ned<br><br>OR<br><br><strong>NOT french</strong>  &lt;-- absolves Tonya<br><strong>english</strong>  &lt;-- indicates Ned<br><br>OR<br><br><strong>NOT tall</strong>  &lt;-- absolves Cindy<br><strong>english</strong>  &lt;-- indicates Ned<br><br>OR<br><br><strong>NOT french</strong>  &lt;-- absolves Tonya<br><strong>blue-eyes</strong>  &lt;-- indicates Ned<br><br>The third option, <strong>english</strong>, is the shortest list, so it is the correct choice.<br><br><strong>Example 2</strong><br><br>Jasmin, Sam, and Rose are enemy spies<br><br>Rick has 3 identifying attributes: brown-hair, glasses, and tall<br>Marcia has 2 identifying attributes: thin and freckled<br>Jasmin has 4 identifying attributes: chinese, short, thin, and brown-hair<br>Matt has 2 identifying attributes: german and freckled<br>Sam has 3 identifying attributes: thin, glasses, and muscular<br>Rose has 3 identifying attributes: german, tall, and thin<br><br>There is one attribute that all the spies have in common: thin. But if we say &quot;thin&quot; then that will indicate Marcia as well. We need to remove Marcia from the list first by saying &quot;NOT freckled&quot;.<br><br><strong>NOT freckled</strong>   &lt;-- This absolves Marcia and Matt<br><strong>thin</strong>  &lt;-- This indicates Jasmin, Sam, and Rose as definitely spies<br><br>This is the shortest possible list of commands that will indicate the three spies.</span>
