   <span class="question-statement">A rectangular map is made of squares, each with a specific height.<br>When it rains, the water falls evenly on all squares.<br><br>The water flows down from any square to an adjacent lower one. The water also flows freely between adjacent squares of equal height. If a square is surrounded by higher squares, the water just accumulates there.<br><br>You are allowed to build drains in some squares.<br>When a square has a drain, all the water that would accumulate on it will leak out instead.<br><br>What is the minimum number of drains that have to be built to leak out all the rain water?<br><br>NOTE: Adjacency is horizontal or vertical. Squares that touch diagonally through a corner aren't adjacent.<br><br>NOTE: The water can never flow outside the map. You can consider it  bounded by walls of infinite height.</span>
