   <span class="question-statement">Detective Sharelock Codes has to inspect a lot of crime scenes. He finds clues scattered around the crime scene, and the location of these clues is diligently recorded by Dr. Watchdog.<br><br>The good doctor sends the coordinates of all clue locations (<var>Xi</var> <var>Yi</var>) to the detective by email. Sharelock then calculates how many rolls of yellow police line <var>L</var> he must purchase in order to protect all of the clues.<br><br>Obviously, all clues must be enclosed in a single &quot;ribboned&quot; area, but in addition, all clues must be at least <const>3</const> feet from the police line at all points.<br><br>A roll of ribbon is <const>5</const> feet long and is quite expensive, so Sharelock wants to buy only as many rolls as needed. Help him by writing a program to calculate the minimal number of rolls required to surround the crime scene.</span>
