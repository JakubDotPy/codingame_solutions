<div class="statement-body"><!-- GOAL -->
<div class="statement-section statement-goal">
<h2><span class="icon icon-goal">&nbsp;</span> <span>The Goal</span></h2>

<div class="statement-goal-content">The aim of this game is to help Blub escape a forest by sending him a sequence of instructions that will make him spell out a given sentence using magic stones.<br />
<br />
For this question, you will be asked to output a single line as a solution. Your rank will be evaluated by the length of your output, which you will want to minimize.</div>
</div>
<!-- RULES -->

<div class="statement-section statement-rules">
<h2><span class="icon icon-rules">&nbsp;</span> <span>Rules</span></h2>

<div>
<div class="statement-rules-content">Your program receives a string of uppercase characters &ndash; the magic phrase Blub needs to spell out &ndash; and must output a sequence of characters, each representing an action for Blub to perform.<br />
These actions will have Blub move around in the forest, interacting with the different stones.<br />
<br />
The forest Blub is trapped works as follows:
<ul>
	<li>The forest contains <const>30</const> zones.</li>
	<li>Blub can move left and right through the zones which are all aligned. He does this when he receives a less-than <action>&lt;</action> or greater-than <action>&gt;</action> sign.</li>
	<li><strong>The last zone is connected to the first zone</strong>, effectively creating a looping area.</li>
	<li>Each zone contains a magic stone upon which is inscribed a rune with which Blub can interact.</li>
</ul>
<br />
Runes work as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Every rune is represented by a letter of the alphabet (A-Z) or an empty space.</li>
	<li>All runes start out as a space.</li>
	<li>Blub can change the value of the letter on the rune by rolling back and forth through the possibilities. He does this when he receives a plus <action>+</action> or minus <action>-</action> character.</li>
	<li><strong>The letter after Z is space. The letter after space is A.</strong></li>
	<li>Blub can trigger a rune. This will add the displayed letter to the phrase he is spelling out. He does this when he receives a dot <action>.</action> character.</li>
	<li>One rune can be triggered several times.</li>
</ul>
You <strong>lose</strong> if:

<ul>
	<li>At the end of Blub&#39;s move sequence, the wrong message is displayed.</li>
	<li>Blub performs 4000 moves or more in the forest.</li>
	<li>You do not supply Blub with a valid sequence of actions.</li>
</ul>

<div class="blk">
<div class="title">Victory Conditions</div>

<div class="text">You win if the magic phrase is spelled out correctly at the end of Blub&#39;s move sequence.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<!-- EXPERT RULES -->

<div class="statement-section statement-expertrules">
<h2><span class="icon icon-expertrules">&nbsp;</span> <span>Expert Rules</span></h2>

<div class="statement-expert-rules-content">For expert CodinGamers, we&#39;ve added the <b>loops</b>! You can skip this section until you&#39;ve really tried the rest.<br />
<br />
These actions are also available:
<ul>
	<li><action>[</action>: If the current rune contains a space, skip all instructions up to the matching closing bracket <action>]</action>, otherwise continue normally.</li>
	<li><action>]</action>: If the current rune contains a space, continue normally, otherwise perform the instructions starting from the matching opening bracket <action>[</action>.</li>
</ul>
This makes it possible to have Blub perform more actions with less characters for your program to output.<br />
<br />
For example, <const>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</const> (A x26) can be achieved with a simple<br />
<action>+..........................</action> as well as with <action>+&gt;-[&lt;.&gt;-]</action>.<br />
<br />
Experiment with different techniques, if you have the guts!</div>
</div>
<!-- EXAMPLES -->

<div class="statement-section statement-examples">
<h2><span class="icon icon-example">&nbsp;</span> <span>Example</span></h2>

<div class="statement-examples-text">If Blub needs to spell out the word <const>AB</const>, you could give him the instructions <action>+.+.</action>. He will:

<ol>
	<li>Make the first rune go from space to A.</li>
	<li>Trigger the A.</li>
	<li>Make rune go from A to B.</li>
	<li>Trigger the B.</li>
</ol>
Alternatively, you could also give him the instructions <action>+.&gt;++.</action> to achieve the same result. Experiment with different tactics!</div>
</div>
<!-- WARNING -->

<div class="statement-section statement-warning">
<h2><span class="icon icon-warning">&nbsp;</span> <span>Note</span></h2>

<div class="statement-warning-content"><b>Don&rsquo;t forget to run the tests by launching them from the &ldquo;Test cases&rdquo; window</b>. You do not have to pass all tests to enter the leaderboard. <b>Each test you pass will earn you some points</b> (for example 10%).<br />
<br />
<strong>Warning:</strong> the tests provided are similar to the validation tests used to compute the final score <strong>but remain different</strong>. This is a &ldquo;harcoding&rdquo; prevention mechanism. Harcoded solutions will not get any points.<br />
<br />
Your score is computed from the number of characters you send to Blub and only if the test case is passed.<br />
<br />
Do not hesitate to switch to debug mode (<img height="18" src="https://www.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=3463235186409" style="opacity:.8;background:#20252a;" width="18" />) if you get stuck.</div>
