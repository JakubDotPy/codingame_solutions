      <span>The Travelling Salesman Problem</span>
    </h1>
    <div class="statement-goal-content">
      A certain number of points is given. The goal is to visit all other points exactly once from the starting point and then return to the starting point again. The starting point is always the first given point.
      <br />
      <br />
      Sounds not very hard at first, but it is an NP-hard problem, so bruteforce is impossible. What we are going to use are heuristic algorithms, which don&#39;t find the optimal solution but a solution close to the best.
      <br />
      <br />
      There is a <a href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-travelling-salesman-problem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">puzzle</a> about the TSP on this website already, which features one heuristic algorithm called &#34;Nearest neighbor&#34;.

        - You win if your output is correct!<br />
        - You lose if your output isn&#39;t correct!<br />

        Given following input: <br />
        4<br />
        0 0   // This is point 0<br />
        0 2   // This is point 1<br />
        2 0   // This is point 2<br />
        2 2   // This is point 3<br />
        <br />
        The shortest path from start point 0 to all other points and back to 0 is 0 - 1 - 3 - 2 - 0,
        therefore we output 0 1 3 2 0 <br />
        Also 0 1 2 3 0 would be valid, but it doesn&#39;t get scored that high, since it has a higher cost <br />
