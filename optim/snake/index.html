        The game zone works as follows:
        <ul><li>The map of the game is 54x96 size (height x width)</li></ul>
        <br />
        
        You <strong>lose</strong> if:
        <ul><li>You get out the map.</li><li>You do not supply a valid sequence of actions.</li><li>The snake head touch his body.</li></ul>

      The snake must always be in movement. If the coordinates of the snake head is 50 10, and his body part is 49 10, 48 10, 47 10, etc... <br />
      You have to move in 3 directions, go up, go down and go right, and not go left because the snake head will touch his body.
      You can move left if you don&#39;t touch the snake body part.
      If you go up, you have to output 50 9.<br />
      If you go down, you have to output 50 11.<br />
      If you go right, you have to output 51 10.<br />
      It&#39;s the basic rules for the snake which is a famous game in the world.<br />
      
      The test cases are random or static.

      Choose a rabbit to catch , get over it and try to get the highest score.
      Your score is calculated like that when you catch some rabbits :<br />
      - You have a penalty if you don&#39;t catch a rabbit in 10 turns. The penalty is turn * NB_TURN_WITHOUT_CATCH_RABBIT.<br />
      - Then the score is calculated, SCORE &#43;&#61; 10000 &#43; add_combo - penalty. add_combo is equal to NB_CATCH_IN_2_TURNS_MIN * 15000. After 2 turns NB_CATCH_IN_2_TURNS_MIN is reset.
